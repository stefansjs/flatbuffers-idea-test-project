# Flatbuffers IDEA test project

This project is meant for testing
[custom plugins](https://www.jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/reference_guide/custom_language_support.html) 
in [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
for the [flatbuffers language](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/).

One goal of this project is to contain very little custom IDE plugins/content so that it can be launched very quickly 
during development and testing of a flatbuffers plugin.
